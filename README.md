# Beat-Up-Boys

A Smash Bros clone I made in SFML (Pre-Alpha).

## Installation

Run these commands in the terminal.

You will need CMake and SFML 2.6.1 for this to succeed.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/hnqcjw/Beat-Up-Boys.git
cd Beat-Up-Boys
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./Beat-Up-Boys
```

gamemoderun is recpmmended for this.
